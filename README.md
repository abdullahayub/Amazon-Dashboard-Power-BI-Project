In this comprehensive Power BI Project, I learn how to create stunning and effective dashboards. I covered everything from data preparation to advanced design techniques, helping you transform your data into compelling visual stories.
I made four Power BI Sheets includes, Project Overview, Products page, Product View, and Product tooltip.

**In Overview:**
- KPI’s: Total sales, Filter sales, Seller Count.
- Charts: Sales by City and State.
- Add Category Section
- And Filters based on Sales and total Units.

**In Products Section:**
- Display products images based on Categories.

**Product View section:**
- KPI’s: Sales amount, Units, Return units, and reviews
- Charts: Total units’ sale by Date
- Filter: Sales according to dates

**Product Tool tip section**
- To View the product details.
